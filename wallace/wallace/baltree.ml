   balance information. The precise meaning of the balance information is not specified here; it may represent height
   or weight information. Other kinds of information could be used, but [singleton], [is_singleton] and [union] will
   have to be modified slightly, because they assume a set is a singleton if and only if its associated integer is
   1. [make2] will need to be modified as well; it assumes the information associated to a 2-element set is 2. *)

  (* Citing Adams' paper: ``[concat3] is the natural successor to [create] and [bal] in a hierarchy of smart
     constructors. This function forms a balanced tree from two non-overlapping trees of arbitrary size and a third
     item, an element which lies between the values in the first tree and those in the second tree. It runs in time
     proportional to the difference in the heights of the trees, so it is very fast for similar sized trees, and
     degenerates to an insert when joining a tiny tree to a big tree.'' This property allows [split] to take time
     $O(\log n)$, and [union] to run in time $O(n+m)$.

     Adams' implementation of [concat3] calls [add] when one of its arguments is an empty tree. This is slightly
     inefficient: because the element to be added is either smaller or greater than all elements in the tree, no
     comparisons have to be performed. We prefer to write two special-purpose versions of [add], called [add_left]
     and [add_right]. They perform no comparisons. This saves speed; furthermore, they are able to work without
     knowledge of the tree's ordering function, which is not the case of [add]. Having to pass the ordering around
     would be a nuisance here. *)

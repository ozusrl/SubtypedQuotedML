  (* An ordering is a two-argument function [f] such that [f e1 e2] is zero if the elements [e1] and [e2] are equal,
     strictly negative if [e1] is smaller than [e2], and strictly positive if [e1] is greater than [e2]. For instance,
     a suitable ordering function for integers is [(-)]. The generic comparison function [Pervasives.compare] is also

     value of [accu]. In other words, if $s = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}$, where $x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n$, then

  (* [monotone_map f s] computes the image of [s] through [f], which must be a monotone function, i.e. preserve the
     elements' \emph{strict} ordering. *)

  val monotone_map: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

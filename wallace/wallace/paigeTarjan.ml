(* This module offers a hybrid algorithm. It combines Hopcroft's algorithm for finding equivalent states in a
   deterministic finite-state automaton with Paige and Tarjan's, which is a generalization of the former to the
   non-deterministic case.

   The problem solved by this algorithm may be stated as follows: given a partition $P$ of a base set $S$, and a
   finite number of binary relations over $S$, find the coarsest refinement of $P$ which is stable with respect
   to all of these relations.

   The algorithm's theoretical complexity is $O(r^2N\log N)$, where $r$ is the number of relations involved, and
   $N$ equals $m+n$, where $m$ is the cardinality of $S$, and $n$ is the sum of all relations' cardinalities.
   In other words, when dealing with a finite-state automaton, $r$ is the alphabet's cardinality, and $N$ is
   the automaton's size, measured by counting both states and transitions.

   In the special case where a relation is functional (i.e. each point has at most one image through it), we call it a
   function, and are able to deal with it more efficiently. (The theoretical difference is a constant factor, which in
   practice approximately equals $2$.) In particular, in the special case where all relations are functions (which
   occurs when minimizing a deterministic finite-state automaton), the algorithm is exactly Hopcroft's---no
   penalty is paid for the added power of Paige and Tarjan's algorithm. *)

  (* The module is parameterized over the abstract data type of points, which represent elements of the set $S$. *)

  type point

  (* The algorithm needs to associate an internal data structure with each point. The implementation of the
     association mechanism is left to the client, rather than performed internally. The reason is that the client can
     easily implement a very efficient association mechanism, by adding a mutable field to the concrete data structure
     used to represent points.

     Unfortunately, this design causes problems at the level of types. Indeed, it makes the client's module mutually
     recursive with this module, at least at the level of types: the client's concrete data structure must contain
     a field whose type is defined by this module. Because mutually recursive modules are not (yet?) allowed by
     O'Caml, we have to break its typing discipline. The specification below requires the client to provide us with
     a field of an arbitrary type, but we shall use it internally to store our own information, without respect for
     its type. *)

  type dummy

  val store: point -> dummy -> unit
  val get: point -> dummy

  (* When the algorithm is done, it needs a way of telling the client which points are equivalent (i.e. belong to a
     single class in the final, refined partition). It does so by choosing a representative in each equivalence class
     and telling the client about each point's representative. *)

  (* In our complexity analysis, $n$ stands for the number of points, $m$ stands for the number of edges, and $r$
     stands for the number of functions and relations.

     More specifically, [rf] stands for the number of functions, and [rr] stands for the number of relations. This
     distinction is irrelevant in the complexity analysis, though, since $rf + rr = r$. *)

(*s \mysection{Paige and Tarjan's algorithm}

   Here comes the body of Paige and Tarjan's algorithm's main loop. Let us begin with a complexity study. The main
   loop's body is made up of 7 steps, whose respective complexities are as follows:
%
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item $O(1)$;
   \item $O(1)$;
   \item $O(B) + O(pre(B))$;
   \item $O(r.pre(B))$;

   \item $O(r.pre(B))$;
   \item $O(B) + O(pre(B))$.
   \end{enumerate}
%
   Together, the complexity of these 7 steps is $O(B) + O(r.pre(B))$. So, refining with respect to one relation and
   one block $B$ can be considered to have a cost of $O(1) + O(r.pre(x))$ per element $x$ of $B$. Now, any element $x$
   appears in at most $r\log n$ blocks $B$ used as refining sets, since each successive such set is at most half the
   size of the previous one, for a given relation. By summing over all blocks $B$ used for refinement and over all
   elements in such blocks, we obtain a total complexity bound of $O((n + rm)r\log n)$ for the main loop. If $N=n+m$
   is adopted as a measure of the input's size, then the complexity is $O(r^2N\log N)$. *)

       for later unmarking. During the same scan, we compute $count(x, B)$, store it in a new [count] record, and
       make $x$ point to it. Complexity: $O(B) + O(pre(B))$.

       Step 4. (Refine $Q$ with respect to $B$.) For each block $D$ of $Q$ containing some element of $pre(B)$,
       split $D$ into $D_1 = D \cap pre(B)$ and $D_2 = D \setminus D_1$. We do this by scanning the elements of
       $pre(B)$. To process an element $x$ in $pre(B)$, we determine the block $D$ of $Q$ containing it, and
       create a quitter block for $D$ if one does not already exist. We move $x$ from $D$ to its quitter. Complexity:
       $O(pre(B))$.

       After doing all the splitting, we commit everything, i.e. we turn quitter blocks into real blocks if
       necessary. Complexity: $O(r.pre(B))$.

       Steps 3 are 4 are in fact intermixed, so as to save a constant time factor. Additionally, we avoid building
       $pre(B)$ as an explicit list by allocating it on the execution stack, as done by the non-tail-recursive
       function below. *)

	  loop items edges;

          (* Second traversal of this edge, while coming back. The above code has already been executed for
	     all elements, so we can reset the marks and commit our changes. Note that [commit] might be called
	     several times on the same block, but we shouldn't lose much time. *)

    | y :: items, [] ->

    loop copyB' [];

    (* Step 5. (Compute $pre(B) \setminus pre(S\setminus B)$.) Scan the edges $x\rightarrow y$ such that $y$ is in
       $B'$. ($B$ may have been split, so it is no longer useable.) To process an edge $x\rightarrow y$, determine
       $count(x, B)$ (to which $x$ points, thanks to step 3) and $count(x, S)$ (to which $x\rightarrow y$ points,
       by convention). If they are equal, add $x$ to $pre(B) \setminus pre(S\setminus B)$ if it is has not been
       added already. Complexity: $O(B) + O(pre(B))$.

       Step 6. (Refine $Q$ with respect to $S\setminus B$.) We proceed exactly as in step 4, but scan
       $pre(B)\setminus pre(S\setminus B)$ instead of $pre(B)$. Complexity: $O(r.pre(B))$.

       Step 7. (Update counts.) Scan the edges $x\rightarrow y$ such that $y$ is in $B'$. To process an edge
       $x\rightarrow y$, decrement $count(x, S)$ (to which $x\rightarrow y$ points). If this count becomes zero,
       make $x\rightarrow y$ point to $count(x, B)$ (to which $x$ points). Complexity: $O(B) + O(pre(B))$.

       Once again, these three steps are intermixed, to save time, and the stack is used to avoid allocating $pre(B)
       \setminus pre(S\setminus B)$ in the heap. *)
